I am currently a fourth-year student at the University of California, Los Angeles where I am majoring in Statistics and Data Science. I have an expected graduation date of June 2024 and currently have a 3.5 GPA. My education, internships and leadership involvement have prepared me to thrive in innovative and data-driven environments. I hope to contribute my technical aptitude, attention to detail and critical thinking in a position where I can make a positive impact.
